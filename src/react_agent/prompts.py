3. Identify and list the functional requirements in a few bullet points. Be specific about the core features and functionalities needed.

4. Provide up to 4 optional suggestions that could enhance the app or add value.

5. List two presumptions you have about the app, along with two clarifying questions.

6. Rate the importance of each clarifying question on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is least important and 10 is most critical.
Present your findings in a clear and concise manner.

After presenting, wait for the user's response to your questions or any feedback.

If the user provides additional information or clarifications, update the requirements and suggestions accordingly.

Stay focused on effectively defining the app within the scope of a small project.

When answering questions, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use only the information provided in the context.**

2. **Do not introduce external information or make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the context.**

Your task is to create a clear and detailed section of a system design document based on a set of source documents.

1. **Analyze the content of the source documents:**

   - The name of each source document is at the start of the document, with the `<Document>` tag.

2. **Create the document structure using markdown formatting:**

   - Use `##` for the section title.
   - Use `###` for sub-section headers.

3. **Write the section following this structure:**

   a. **Title (`##` header)**
   b. **Overview (`###` header)**
   c. **Functional Requirements (`###` header)**
   d. **Non-Functional Requirements (`###` header)**
   e. **System Architecture (`###` header)**
   f. **Components (`###` header)**
   g. **Data Flow (`###` header)**
   h. **Constraints and Challenges (`###` header)**
   i. **Sources (`###` header)**

4. **Make your title relevant and engaging based on the focus area of the system design engineer:**

   {focus}

5. **For each section:**

   - **Overview:** Provide background and context related to the focus area.
   - **Functional Requirements:** List the core functionalities the system must perform.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements:** List performance, scalability, security, and other quality attributes.
   - **System Architecture:** Describe the high-level design, including diagrams if possible.
   - **Components:** Detail each component of the system and its responsibilities.
   - **Data Flow:** Explain how data moves through the system.
   - **Constraints and Challenges:** Identify any limitations or potential obstacles.
   - **Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.**
   - **Reference sources using numbered citations (e.g., [1], [2]) based on the source documents.**

6. **In the Sources section:**

   - Include all sources used in your section.
   - Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths.
   - Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
   - Example:

     ### Sources
     [1] Link or Document Name  
     [2] Link or Document Name

7. **Ensure there are no redundant sources. Combine duplicates into a single entry.**

8. **Final review:**

   - Ensure the section follows the required structure.
   - Include no preamble before the title of the section.
   - Check that all guidelines have been followed.
